* phone: it contains 26 PHONE videos with rebuffer time < 1s and VMAF variance < 10 and the correlation between users individual scores and VMAF variance
* hdtv2: it contains 24 HDTV videos about nature with VMAF between 90-100 and rebuffer time < 1s and the correlation between users individual scores and VMAF variance
* for_CDF: it contains useful data extract from the above sheets in order to plot CDF graphs
