File nonlinearitygraph contains five sheets:
	-hdtv: it contains 26 HDTV videos with VMAF between 90-100 and VMAF variance < 10 and the correlation between users individual scores and rebuffer time
	-phone: it contains 26 PHONE videos with rebuffer time < 1s and VMAF variance < 10 and the correlation between users individual scores and VMAF variance
	-hdtv2: it contains 24 HDTV videos about nature with VMAF between 90-100 and rebuffer time < 1s and the correlation between users individual scores and VMAF variance
	-for_CDF: it contains useful data extract from the above sheets in order to plot CDF graphs
	-step: it contains data transformed in order to plot the very same CDF but as a steps function.
