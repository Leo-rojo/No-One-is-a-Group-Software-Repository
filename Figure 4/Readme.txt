The input to the nestedkfold script is a .csv file which contains the individual scores and the Average and variance of vmaf and sum of rebuffering_duration for each of the hdtv video (example file is already provided).

run the script nestedkfold.py, it will perform 15 round of the same experiments (there is a randomic shuffle of data that makes the results a bit variable, so it is possible to compare the results for each shuffle) 
and results will be added to the Figure 4 folder.
